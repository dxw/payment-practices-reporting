  * This actor manages the sending of confirmation emails via the GDS Notify service.

  *
  * On receipt of a `'poll` message it calls the delivery service to attempt delivery
  * of any pending confirmation.
  *
  * If delivery was attempted (regardless of the outcome) then the actor immediately sends
  * itself another `'poll` message to see if there are any more confirmations to send.
  *
  * If no delivery was attempted it takes no action and waits for the next scheduled event.
